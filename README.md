# Chat Checker

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying text as either generated by ChatGPT or originating from other sources. By utilizing web scraping techniques to collect a diverse dataset, the project seeks to create an accurate and robust classification tool. The model will be integrated into a user-friendly application, allowing users to assess the source of text inputs. Rigorous evaluation will be central to the development process, ensuring the model's reliability.

This program is for my senior project in my undergrad program. You can check on the most recent updates here.

I have streamlit code that works, I am having trouble getting my trained model file in the repository due to size.

## Planned Development Schedule - On schedule

* Make a base model with sample data (week 1-2)
* **Put this model in a simple application (week 3-4)**
* Utilize web scraping to gather diverse human-made data (week 5-6)
* Generate comparable data from ChatGPT (week 7-8)
* Optimize model using the complete data and other optimization techniques (week 9-10)
* Construct a better app interface for usability (week 11-12)
* Create a comprehensive report of my findings (week 13-14)
