# Chat Checker

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying text as either generated by ChatGPT or originating from other sources. By utilizing web scraping techniques to collect a diverse dataset, the project seeks to create an accurate and robust classification tool. The model will be integrated into a user-friendly application, allowing users to assess the source of text inputs. Rigorous evaluation will be central to the development process, ensuring the model's reliability.

This entire application including the trained model weights are available for you here. running the application should be done from the front_end folder. Explore around and try he application for yourself.

On my windows machine I run the following command to run the application from the main directory:
```
python -m streamlit run front_end/front_end.py
```

You will need your own OpenAI API key if you plan to create the data for yourself from scratch.
