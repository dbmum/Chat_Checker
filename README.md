# Chat Checker

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying text as either generated by ChatGPT or originating from other sources. By utilizing web scraping techniques to collect a diverse dataset, the project seeks to create an accurate and robust classification tool. The model will be integrated into a user-friendly application, allowing users to assess the source of text inputs. Rigorous evaluation will be central to the development process, ensuring the model's reliability.

This program is for my senior project in my undergrad program. You can check on the most recent updates here.

The current version of this code is running out of memory, so I am saving it to try it on another machine. I am just trying to get something working for now
